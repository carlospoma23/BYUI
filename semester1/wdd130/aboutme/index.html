            <h4>Hello Everyone!<p> My name is Carlos Poma, I'm from Peru but currently I'm living with my family in Utah, US.
                My 3 great passions are music, soccer and technology. My father whom I consider my hero was the driver of my 2 great passions.<p> 
               When I was a child I always enjoyed watching my father play the guitar and I was excited to see him play soccer. What wonderful years! Now I play guitar, charango and ukulele.
               My passion for technology was born in high school, I still remember that day, I had a computer class and the teacher told me and my classmates to turn on the computers and I didn't know how to do it. I felt embarrassed and a little sad. That experience was a key moment in my life. Since then I began to inquire and study about computing and technology. Now I already have some experience in the IT world and I enjoy it very much.
